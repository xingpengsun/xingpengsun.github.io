              My name is Xingpeng Sun, currently a senior undergraduate student at UW-Madison. I am a STEM student, 
              double-majored in <a
              href="https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/letters-science/computer-sciences/computer-sciences-bs/"
              target="_blank">B.S. Computer Sciences</a>, and <a
              href="https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/letters-science/mathematics/mathematics-bs/"
              target="_blank"> Mathematics</a>. I transferred 37 credits from AP and summer school.
               The courses I took are mostly related to my majors (CS & Math) and 
              under the College of Letters & Science. This course guide may be helpful for students pursuing a similar 
              academic path. Here is a detailed guide of all courses I have taken at UW-Madison.

                      <h3>CS/ECE 539</h3>
                      <p>This is a machine learning course talking about artificial neural networks, which means if you are an ML fan, you should
                        consider taking CS 539 (I also notice that many graduate students will take this course in their first year).
                        It first gives you an overview of the essential math background of ML,
                        such as linear algebra, probability, and useful evaluation metrics. Then, it goes deeper into machine learning components
                       such as classification models, SVM, MLP, convolution neural networks, deep learning, and much
                      other related knowledge. There are 1 midterm and 1 final exam, which are challenging. However,
                      professor Hu is very nice to undergraduate students, and he will curve undergrad scores at the end
                      of the semester. This course has a final project which allows you to do something cool with the artificial neural network.</p>

                      <p>This is a very popular course at UW-Madison lol. Its topic ranges from convex 
                        and linear programming to nonconvex and combinatorial models. You will learn to describe problems
                        provided in plain text in mathematical models and build the ability to make use of Julia Optimization
                        models to solve exciting engineering problems. It has 1 midterm and a final project. You will work
                        within a team to use optimization models to solve real-world problems (interesting). By the way, the 
                        weekly homework is sometimes challenging.

                      <h3>CS 537</h3>
                      <p>The famous operating systems course. The course material is divided into three little pieces: virtualization,
                        concurrency, and persistence, giving a fundamental overview of operating systems. Professor Mike talks fast in 
                        lectures, so it is really important to read the textbook (which is written by Prof Remzi). There's no doubt that
                        CS537 is a tough course (at least all my friends agree on this). The project is not very straightforward, and debugging
                        the xv6 code is definitely a challenge too. Many CS major students take this course to fulfill the "Software & Hardware"
                        requirement.

                        is taught in the flip-classroom mode: watch lecture videos before class and then do quiz in class.
                        There are 6 exams in total and the workload is reasonable. One interesting thing about this course: 
                        you are asked to write unit summary for each unit, so it's not only a course to practice your coding skill
                        but also writing skill.

                        this course. The projects are open-ended that give students the opportunity to show their

                      <p>There are many topics under CS639, and I took "Introduction to Computer Vision" 
                        in Fall 2021. Undoubtedly, computer vision is one of the most popular research
                        fields in Computer Science. Each year, tons of computer vision applications and research papers
                        are produced and implemented in the real world. However, this course's content is a little out-of-date.
                        We did not cover state-of-art CV topics in the lecture, so if you are interested in computer vision,
                        this course is just a good starter. There is a final project which gives students the freedom to explore
                        the computer vision world and make use of computer vision techniques. The course workload is not large
                        in comparison to other 500-level CS courses. However, the homework is written in Matlab, and it takes me
                        some time to get used to it.

                      <p>This is the intro to probability course, giving you basic ideas about random variables,
                        distributions, and probability knowledge. I took this course to meet a Math major Elective requirement.
                        In Fall 2021, we have weekly discussion to discuss lecture topics and do exercise together.
                        The homework is relatively easy and the exam is also straight-forward. A nice course with light workload.

                      <h3>ENGL 150</h3>
                      <p> ENGL150 is a popular general education course that meets literature requirements. The course
                        talks about Asian Americans' history and life in America. The workload is high. You are 
                        asked to read ~6 books, write two essays, and take two exams in this course. This is not the general education course
                        that you can easily get credits, but it's worthy of spending time on for those who like history and are interested in Asian 
                        American's life.

                      <h3>CS 638</h3>
                      <p>In my opinion, CS638 is an internship course (while you do not get paid). You got the 
                        chance to work with large tech companies, such as Epic Systems, Capital One, etc. Mentors
                        from companies provide ambiguous requirements, and your team spends a whole semester implementing
                        it in codes and making an app. In the lecture, the instructors led us to do the user story and prototype, and let
                        us practice DevOps such as agile workflow. Outside the lecture hall, we work in teams to develop an app
                        just like what you would do in an internship. A practical computer science course for students who want
                        to experience the industrial software engineer life.

                      <p>A humanity course that I took purely for interest. This course has only three essays and no exams.
                        I took it during the pandemic, so basically, all I did was listen to recordings, read books,
                        and write essays every month. The topic is about Vietnam War, mainly focusing on the history of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.
                        If you are also interested in history and want to have a look at Southeastern Asian region from 
                        historical, political, and ethnic sides, then I strongly suggest you consider this course.

                      <p>The <s>controversial</s> famous algorithm course here at UW-Madison. First of all, this course 
                        is definitely a fruitful course, introducing topics like divide and conquer, dynamic programming, 
                        graphs, NP, etc. These are popular topics in SWE interviews, so CS577 is really a useful course 
                        that may facilitate your job-finding process. While this is also a challenging course. Homeworks are 
                        proof-based, so we not only write codes but also extensively do mathematical proof, which is hard. 
                        Anyway, CS577 is a compulsory course so take it as soon as you are prepared.

                        and homework are a little out-dated. There are 3 problem sets and 3 group projects. Professor 
                        Xiangyao Yu explained concepts quite well and control the speed of teaching in a comfort pace.

                      <p> This is the course focusing on solving Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). Unlike

                        and understanding the math concepts. Given this premise, MATH319 gives me the opportunity to

                        course teaches you techniques in modeling real-world problems in differential equations and solving it.
                        In spring 2021, we have 3 exams and weekly online homework.

                      <h3>CS 540</h3>
                      <p> One of my favorite course at UW-Madison. Currently, AI is really on-fire on social media and in our life.
                        If you are a AI fan, consider taking this course as your first AI course. In the first part of CS540, instructors
                        would introduce some traditional AI algorithms, such as A* search, game theory, etc. Then, the most exciting part comes--Machine Learning.
                        CS540 won't emphasize too much on ML, but gives you a flavor of traditional supervised / unsupervised learning applications,
                        such as classification, regression, convolutional neural network, etc. There are 10 well-designed homework. We get a change to implement 
                        AI stuff in python and train AI models by ourselves. I also peer-mentored this course in Spring 2021, and here is the <a href="https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~sharonli/courses/cs540_spring2021/index.html" target="_blank">LINK</a>

                        3. foundation of systems. This is the traditional CS course that really emphasizes details 
                        and C coding skills. You will learn fundamental computer knowledge from this course, such as memory, 
                        cache, pages, etc. I would say CS354 is a difficult course and needs students to work hard and learn things quickly to succeed.

                        In fall 2020, this is a pure math course extensively emphasized on proof. I took this course to 
                        fulfill advanced mathematics requirement for my Math major. Personally, I would suggest not taking this course too early 
                        (for example in Sophomore first semester) or under online teaching form. Also, for students interested in learning more 
                        about how computer science is used in numerical analysis, CS513 might be a better fit.

                        Roman culture, and also Roman literature. In the summer, students have to read 10-70 pages of reading materials 
                        and write a 4-pages essay each week. The book assigned in Summer 2020 is "Aeneid." It is a challenge for a STEM student
                        to read ancient literature, but once you try, you will fall in love with literature.

                        Just like all analysis courses, MATH 421 is a proof-based course too. The good news is, 
                        the topic is traditional and familiar to most students, so it is a friendly analysis course for math majors.
                        Students usually take MATH 421 with MATH 340 to fulfill the intermediated analysis and linear algebra requirements 
                        that 500-level courses demand.
                        In Spring 2020, we had three exams and weekly homework.

                        especially math and computer science, so a good linear algebra background is a must for future STEM studies.
                        MATH 340 covers topics like the linear equation, determinant, basis, singular matrix, eigenvalue, etc., and is 
                        more computing-based than MATH 341. Also, this is a prerequisite for almost all MATH 400-level, 500-level, and 600-level 
                        courses, so take this course (or MATH 341) early if you want a Math major.

                      <p> ESL 118 must be a nightmare for all international freshmen. This is the 
                        academic writing course that all international students must take. Students are 
                        asked to write three academic essays, each 4-8 pages. I think ESL 118 is a helpful class
                        for the reason that it teaches students to improve their academic writing skills, and academic 
                        writing is a crucial ability in their future careers. Thus, students should take ESL 118 as soon as possible.
                        Also, the course load is hefty, so taking ESL 118 in the first year is a good option (usually, students 
                        do not have challenging major courses in the first year).

                      <p> ECON 302 talks about Macroeconomics. Economics is an interesting subject and it's worthy
                        to spend a semester learning some fundenmental economics knowledge (though I'm not an Econ major).
                        Macroeconomics contains topics like GDP, inflation, recession, economic models, etc. The homework is not heavy, but 
                        requires time and thinking. I took ECON 302 to 
                        fulfill the social science general education requirement.

                      <h3>BOTANY 240</h3>
                      <p> BOTANY 240 is a course that fulfills Biological science general education requirements. The courseload is 
                        below average (at least I think this way): there is basically no homework. I experienced my first field trip in this class. 
                        However, the exam is not easy. Students have to read the textbook and memorize many botanical terms and lecture notes to get good grades. 
                        Extra credits are provided, so the grading is flexible.

                      <h3>MATH 234</h3>
                      <p> This is my first college course. MATH 234 talks about multi-variable calculus. 
                        The course content is abstract for freshman students, so be prepared to self-teaching and 
                        ask for help. MATH 234 is a course that has TA-led discussion (most Math courses do not have discussion sessions).
                        In Fall 2019, we had three exams, and they were all relatively easy. Students in STEM majors are required to take this course.

                      <h3>CS 200</h3>
                      <p> CS 200 is the first introductory computer science course. You are going to write your first line of code in this class. 
                        Many students with AP Computer Science could jump CS200 and directly attend CS300. 
                        The course content is very easy, containing variables, loops, classes, etc. While, the exam is not easy. It requires you to be very careful 
                        and extensively focus on programming details. If you intend to major in CS, then definitely take this 
                        class as soon as possible.

                      <p> CS 403 is the intership course. Once you have an CS&DS intership outside campus, you need 
                        to take this course. The course intends to give you information about computer science career and 
                        helps student to build up career goal. It is a 1-credit course, so the courseload is small. In summer 2022, 
                        we also get the chance to develop and revise our resume, cover letter, and graduate school statement with the help 
                        of instructors. I think it's a practial course.
